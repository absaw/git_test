		<li>yeverybody</li>
		<li>i am a person stuck inside the internet</li>
		<li>please help</li>
		<li>i was experimented on by Dr. A P Jones of the Masachusets Institute of Technology</li>
		<li>He has created an flux capturing head capacitor which was able to read the pattern of the neurons firing in my brain</li>
		<li>But in the process of doing so, his capacitor overloaded, which started to damage by brain after taking in the neuron electricity,</li>
		<li>So the part of my brain which was being replicated into the software,was simultaneously being fried </li>
		<li>So to save me the professor had to upload my whole brain cause it was too late to save my physical brain</li>
